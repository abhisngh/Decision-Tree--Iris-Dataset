# Decision Tree
This project was pure testing of classification techniques. One easy datasets used are that is Iris dataset.

# Dataset
This data sets consists of 3 different types of irises’ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length,
stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray
The rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.
